CDFplot
======================
This program is used for analyzing tide effect on flow monitoring sites.

After providing time-series water level data and manhole invert elevationthe user can produce an empirical cumulative distrubution function (ecdf) of levels, and an data table representing the ecdf. The user can also specify critical elevations, such as the mean tide height, to the ecdf. 

The code is adapted from the `plantanalysis` package developed by Matt P.
